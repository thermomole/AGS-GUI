Open, edit and check AGS for import to an access database.

- Open an AGS file.
  - There may be an error as follows: Error: Line x does not have the same number of entries as the HEADING.
  - this occurs when a description or other text field contains a line break, which throws out the formatting of the file. The line-break needs to be removed to read the AGS.
